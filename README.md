## General Information
- Project showcasing the basics of HTML and CSS spacing on a static website

## Technologies Used
- HTML 5
- CSS 3

## Project Status
Project is: _no longer being worked on_

(good exercise to humble myself in responsive CSS designs, but I am moving on in learning concepts and practicing, no longer paying this project time or effort)


## Room for Improvement
- Specificity in my HTML classes and IDs need some work. When transitioning over to CSS, it becamse cluttered very fast. A lot of this could have been avoided with certain sections belonging to a more general class instead of IDs and vice versa.
- Layout specifically for the nav bar, color blocks and font examples. The color blocks are currently set up as inline-blocks but I know I'm missing something there as I tried resizing a few times, each with a different result from the one I was looking for.
-Styling nested elements need work. Running this site full screen allows the text in the color blocks to be positioned relatively where I want them to be, but any resizing, and there are issues.
